Programming Principles and Practice Using C++ (PPPUC++)
=======================================================

This repository contains the drills, exercises, and other assignments, for the classic book 'Programming Principles and Practice Using C++' (PPPUC++), written by the creator of C++ himself, Dr. Bjarne Stroustrup. Please note there are no assignments in chapter 1. In addition, the exercises for chapter 2 (p.55) are not included because they are highly subjective. Other exercises throughout the book may not be included if, for example, they ask the reader to write something on a piece of paper, examine compiler errors, flawed code, etcetera. Dr. Stroustrup encourages self-initiative when completing the exercises (p.5). The student is encouraged to explore, be creative, and use their imaginations. The same thought process is also applied to the drills of this book.
